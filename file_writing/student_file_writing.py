'''Write a valid docstring for this function, 

Dictionary Structure:
    Outer Dictionary: Car brands (e.g., "Toyota", "Honda").
    Inner Dictionary: Car models belonging to a specific brand.
    Tuple: Contains the price (float), available color (string), and isForSale (boolean).
    For additonal context, see the above car_sample_database


Goal: write to a file with car information for all cars that are avaliable for sale
each line should be in the format of the following: 
This car is a "color" "brand" "model", it costs $"price" 


You may find it useful to write helper functions for this 
The file is open for writing, you do not need to read data from a file for this function
a smaller version of the dictionary will be provided above for your reference

Any helper functions you create it is good practice to also write docstrings for them as well
