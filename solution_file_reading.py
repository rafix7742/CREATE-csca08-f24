File Structure and Data Parsing:

Input File (customers.txt): 
    Contains customer data in the format:
    Name (String)
    Budget (Integer)
    Preferred Color (String)
    END to mark the end of each customer's record.

Dictionary Structure:
    Outer Dictionary: Car brands (e.g., "Toyota", "Honda").
    Inner Dictionary: Car models belonging to a specific brand.
    Tuple: Contains the price (float), available color (string), and forSale (boolean).

The function will:
    Read and parse the file. Assume that the file is already open.
    Match customers with cars within their budget and preferred color(s).
    Return a list of dictionaries 'customers' representing each customer and their potential cars.


Notes:
    You are given constants for sepraating data from certain lines
    You may look at the data in "insert file name"
